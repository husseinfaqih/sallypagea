It started from questioning fiction and reality 
Through dreams and memories.
What is real and what is imagined (fantasy)?
By implementing my memories and dreams into a text generating AI, those memories and dreams were 
Altered and added on by the AI, the original text is partly apparent now and the new text could be both 
Real and unreal.
What makes a story real? What makes our experience true (valid)?

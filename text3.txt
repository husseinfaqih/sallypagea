She was on a bed outside, on a structure a little bit higher than the ground with borders that are 40cm high,
There was one door on either side of the structure, the doors were lower, so on the ground level,
On the side of the left door, there was a small fridge, and through it, you can enter the house,
Her friend was sleeping on her left side. She looked around and saw on the right side fields of green grass, with some houses scattered around.
From the foot of the bedside, she could see an alleyway and houses on both sides of it.
A huge creature came towards her from the meadows, she was wondering if it was a cow or a hippo but when he came closer it was a dog! A dog with a hippo face and a cow body, started attacking her and she could only defend herself with her pillow, and suddenly another dog appeared but this one is smaller and more like a dog, she was worried about how she can fight away both of them at the same time?
She tried to wake her friend up but he was deep in sleep, the big dog tried to bite her finger and suddenly a woman voice shouted at the dogs and send them away, She was the neighbour and these were her dogs, the neighbour came worrying if her dogs have hurt someone but she was not apologetic, the neighbour brought a nice deep green ceramic plate with white flowers and brown twigs drawn on it, Then she went inside the house and filled it with water, she put it outside and said that the dogs will be friendly if the plate was here and they could drink from it. Then the neighbour asked her why are they sleeping outside? She answered that they always sleep outside in the summer but the neighbour said that it wasn't summer anymore, in fact it was freezing cold,
She looked around and saw that the neighbour is right, it was cold and the grass had a layer of winter frost.
Why they didn't want to go inside? What are they afraid of? Why is she feeling more comfortable outside?

How were they afraid that the neighbour could do this to him? How was that fear that the neighbour was afraid of that he had two cats on the bedside? What a great story this guy had. She was a good neighbour because he liked her.

How did this girl look? What a wonderful picture this girl was.

One of the biggest emotions in my relationship was that she was okay and cared. I don't have a problem getting angry and there are just a couple of people out in the field here like you, when they were in love and are very nice, but to this girl outside of the bedroom she was frightened that it was cold and the neighbour had a toy, it was her way of saying ''Hey, I'm pregnant''. The other night, it was like the car was a little too dark inside and the neighbour would have been scared. The car had a lot of seats and the apartment walls were huge and they would have painted them white. She would have put this little bit of paint across it so that when she put it down and put on a pillow, she would have more of it.

A very special picture in my book I loved. ------------ How did this girl change in the world after that first birthday? This little girl had to have her first birthday party in three days. ------------ They were a really lovely company, they were amazing, they had three walls which were big - they had three different bedrooms and three different bedrooms - they had all the different places and a wall, they had the different furniture that was coming out of the door but everything was nice and everything was very big. ------------ How would a house-owner do this in his family? I don't know how he would put it. ------------ How would a house owner do this in his family? I think a little bit of it would be better done. ------------ How would you react if you had to do the house-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-couch-1284
